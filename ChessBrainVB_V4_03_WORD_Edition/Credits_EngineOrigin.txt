ChessBrainVB is a chess program (32 bit Windows) that communicates with a chess GUI via the winboard protocol (or UCI since V3.6) and can be used with  MsOffice-VBA (EXCEL/WORD) also.
Features: support for up to 64 cores. 
Endgame tablebases are no longer supported. (for the Excel version the online EGTB of lichess.org are accessable)

This engine is writen in Visual Basic 6. It does NOT use bitboards. The board uses the classic 10x12 board array.
Search logic and evaluation is based an Stockfish with adaptions to non-bitboard data structure and search changes 
that perform better for slower move generation and evaluation.

### CREDITS
This chess engine is based on the source of the engine "LarsenVB" by Luca Dormio (http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ludormio/download.htm).
LarsenVB was inspired by "Faile 0.6 by" Adrien M. Regimbald, which was also the base for the engine "Sjeng".
I want to thank Luca Dormio for his permission to use his LarsenVB source. 

ChessBrainVB is also based on many great ideas from the following people: 

Marco Costabla/Tord Romstad/Joona Kiiski (Stockfish sources): Search logic, king safety, piece evaluation

Ed Schroder (REBEL descriptions):  Killer move strucure, Search extensions

Raimund Heid (Protector sources):  Material draw logic

Norbert Raimund Leisner: Logo file

The Syzygy tablebases were created by Ronald de Man. Fathom.exe was created by github user basil00.
